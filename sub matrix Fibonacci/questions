1.Problem : Sub Grand Sum

Juan Marquinho is verifying a conjecture on sums of elements in sub matrices of large matrices. The
conjecture involves computing the number Fibonacci (S mod 50) where S is the sum of elements in a sub
matrix, and mod 50 indicates the remainder of S when divided by 50. Fibonacci numbers are the defined as
follows:
Fibonacci (1) = 1, Fibonacci (2) =1 and for all n &gt; 2, Fibonacci (n) = Fibonacci (n-1) + Fibonacci (n-2). The
first few Fibonacci numbers are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, …..
Since the number of sub matrices to compute is very large, he needs some help. Write a program to help
him. 
Specifically, given a N x N matrix and a set of sub matrices, compute the numbers Fibonacci (S mod 50) for
each of the sub matrices, where S is the sum of elements of the sub matrix.
Input Format:
The first line gives three space separated integers R, C, N, giving the number of rows, number of columns
and the number of sub matrices
The next R lines each contain, space separated C integers giving the elements of the rows 
The next N lines each contain space separated four integers giving the top left and bottom right coordinates
of the sub matrices (rows are numbered 0 to R-1 and columns are numbered 0 to C-1, and the top left
corner of the matrix has coordinates 0, 0.
Output Format:
N lines each giving the Fibonacci (S mod 50) of the sub matrices.

Fibonacci number is 89.

2.Problem : Greedy Hostel Owner

You know that summers are at peak this year and every day is hot and due to this everyone is using coolers
and ACs and a lot of electricity is consumed by the people.
You are living in a hostel and your hostel owner decided to charge extra for electricity consumption. To
achieve this he put one separate electricity meter for every room and connected all those meters to central
meter.
But the hostel owner is a bit greedy and wants to manipulate the meters to show a reading that is more
than the actual consumption of electricity. He also encrypted all the meters with alphabets. The technique
he used for encrypting is as follows:
Every meter has 6 Alphabets i.e. 6 digits.
Every alphabet is in upper case.
Allowed alphabets are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J.
A corresponds to 0, B = 1 and similarly C = 2, D = 3, E = 4, F = 5, G = 6, H = 7, I = 8, J = 9
The interpretation rules change as follows:
If the alphabet next to J is A, then J represents 0. Similarly, if the alphabet after I is B, then I counts as 1
(and not 8), the alphabet after H is C, then H represents 2. The same is true if D follows G and if E follows F.
Note that A, B, C, D and E will always retain their respective values. 

When J is not followed by A, J will represent 9 and similar rules for I, H, G and F
You are given central meter reading and encrypted readings of all the meters in the hostel. Your task is to
find out whether the owner is Greedy or Innocent. If he is greedy then print the unit
difference otherwise print innocent.
Owner is greedy if and only if 
(units of all meters in the hostel except central meter &lt; central meter units)
Input Format:
First line contains an integer N, giving the number of rooms in the hostel. 
The next line contains N strings each of length 6 characters giving the readings of the meters in the rooms
The next line contains an integer that gives the reading in the central meter
Output Format:
First line containing either GREEDY or INNOCENT
If the first line is GREEDY, the next line should contain the difference (as a decimal number) between the
central meter reading and the consumption shown in the rooms.
Constraints:
Number of rooms &lt;= 100 

Example 1
Input 
3 
JAABHF JAACJA JAACDA 
500
Output 
GREEDY 
105
Explanation 
In the reading JAABHF, J represents 0 since it is followed by A, and hence the reading is 000175. Similarly,
the other readings are 000200 and 000230. The total of the readings in the rooms is 605 and the central
meter reading is 500. Thus the owner is GREEDY and he stole 605-500 = 105 units.

Example 2
Input 
8 
JAACJA JAABCH JAABHD JAACAF JAJAJJ JAABEJ JAACJJ JAACDI 
1500
Output 
INNOCENT
Explanation 
The readings are, 

000200, 000127, 000173, 000205, 0000099, 000149, 000299, 000238
The sum of these readings is 1490 &lt; 1500, the central meter reading. Hence the owner is INNOCENT.

3.Problem : Numbers with non-decreasing digits

Some numbers such as 7, 234, 12378 have the digits that are non-decreasing when we read them from left
to right. In this problem, we want to find the largest such number less than or equal to a given number N.
Input Format:
Integer N
Output Format:
Largest integer M ≤ N that has its digits non-decreasing. The output should not contain leading zeros.
Constraints:
N &lt;= 10^18
Example 1
Input 
89
Output 
89
Explanation 

89 itself has non-decreasing digits.

Example 2
Input 
549
Output 
499
Explanation 
From 500 to 549, the integers have 5 as the leading digit and the second digit must be less than or equal to
4. But then, such a number cannot have its digits non decreasing.
